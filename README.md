# SNU Connect

An app to help you connect with people with similar interests across the Shiv Nadar University campus that you otherwise might never meet. 

This app helps you:
  - Make new connections
  - Partake in events that you might not be able to due to lack of someone to go with
  - Deal with shyness/anxiety of not knowing anyone on campus

## Getting started

Flutter's [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) should help you get Flutter up and running on your system.

## Features

1. Create your own event (form a hackathon team, return a lost necklace, organize a conference, carpool and more!)
2. Register for events across campus
3. Chat with the host and attendees of any event you create or register for
4. Filter events by category / Search for events by a unique (shareable) 4 digit code 
5. View all registered / create events on your profile screen
